# Mario

Mario is a plumbing script for Linux which will hopefully vaguely resemble the feature on
Plan9 and ACME.

It depends on `wl-clipboard` (or `xclip`). It also uses `xdg-open` for certain functionalities.

#### What does it do?
It takes the text that you feed it and does certain actions depending on the text.
For instance, feeding it a word will open that word in the dictionary. Feeding it
a link will open the link, etc.

#### Usage:
Highlight the text you'd like to put through the plumber, then run the `mario`
command. It's recommended to bind the `mario` command to a keyboard shortcut.
